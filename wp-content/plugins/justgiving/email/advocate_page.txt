Dear [firstname],

Thanks for taking the challenge to lead your ship mates and deny the drinks you love for 10 days. With you in charge, you’ll be helping our crew to save lives at sea. If you’ve requested an H2Only Captain’s kit, it should be with you within the next 10 working days. In the meantime here’s everything you need to guide you through choppy waters and make it to day 10 a hero.
 
We’ll help you stay strong for 10 days – and raise money for the RNLI.
 
You’ll be stronger as a crew – and you’ll raise even more money.

In the meantime, spread the word and get as many Ship Mates onboard as you possibly can. Even if they don’t want to go H2Only, they can sponsor your crew.
