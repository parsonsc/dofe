Well played! Your Sport First has raced into our gallery.

Dear [firstname],

Your Sport First is special, so thank you for sharing it with us.
You’re playing your part in something really big. Quite literally. Your Sport First will join thousands of others in our online gallery and be featured on a big screen at the Commonwealth Games 2014 in Glasgow.

Every Sport First is a moment to celebrate. So we’d like to introduce you to someone very special – your Sport First teammate.
