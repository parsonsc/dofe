Dear [firstname],

Thanks for taking the challenge to deny the drinks you love for 10 days. With every sip and every penny raised, you’ll be helping to save lives at sea. Your H2Only kit is in the post, but in the meantime here’s everything you need to guide you through choppy waters from day one to 10.

We’ll help you stay strong for 10 days – and raise money for the RNLI.

You’ll help our lifeboat crews to keep doing what they do every day, dropping everything to go out on the water and save lives.

If you’re going H2Only, it’s only fair you take them with you. You’ll be stronger as a crew – and you’ll raise even more money.

In the meantime, spread the word and get as many people onboard as you possibly can. Even if they don’t want to go H2Only, they can sponsor you.
